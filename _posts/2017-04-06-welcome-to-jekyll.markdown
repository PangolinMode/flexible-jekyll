You might be wondering what the pangolin, a mammal native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia, has to do with Pokémon. The answer is very little. To be exact, there is a single Pokémon that appears to be based on the animal, and that Pokémon is Sandslash.

Can you feel its immense power coming throug
And that's how I knew "Pangolin Mode" was the perfect name for this blog.

Now that I've eloquently explained why this blog exists, let me actually tell you what I'm thinking I'll write on this here subdomain.

<h2> What to expect on this blog in 2020 </h2>
<ul>
<li> Blog posts about Pokémon cards, <i>baby</i> </li>
<li> My personal stories related to Pokémon and the Pokémon Trading Card Game </li>
<li> Musings about this blog's mascot, a Sandslash </li>
<li> Some other pop culture stuff throw in the mix (as long as I can find some way of relating it to Pokémon) </li>
</ul>

So come back once in awhile to see what's new. I'll be updating my Insta story every time a new post goes up.

See ya later trainer!

A story about how I fell in love with Pokémon cards again
Quick story: A year or so ago I decided I wanted to write a short story and landed on a pangolin as the protagonist. Since then, I've become passionate about their survival.

In December of 2019, my stepbrother was showing me the collection of Pokémon cards he had brought with him for Christmas vacation. At first, I dismissed them, thinking I was over that childhood phase, knowing that as a kid I never really played the game but only collected them. "What was the point?" I thought. Being stuck in an apartment in Vietnam all day however leads you to want to do pretty much anything besides watch more YouTube. So I asked, "can you remind me how to play?"

I quickly discovered he was not as familiar with the rules as I expected. Even worse, he had a random assortment of Energy cards with random Pokémon types, rendering our games frustrating and slow. But that frustration built up an itch. "How is a deck meant to be built?" "What can I do to execute my gameplan?" And thus a fire was lit deep in my soul to understand the Pokémon Trading Card Game. If I was feeling a rush from constructing these two haphazard decks to play against my stepbrother, what would happen if I actually had a decent collection to work with?

That fire would become an inferno a couple months later when my friend visited me, and we would find a bevy of booster packs and theme decks available at a toy store in a Koreatown mall (read: I hardly went outside pre-covid-19, and in my head, I had to buy cards in-person.) -->
